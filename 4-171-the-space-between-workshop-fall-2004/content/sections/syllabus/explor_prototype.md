description: In this handout a description of the day to day workings and processes
  of the studio are described in detail. Here the very first iteration of the Space
  Between Workshop is described, with all the steps undertaken by the students. The
  values of "path versus place" are debated. A series of models are described and
  built in which students come to understand the value of the Space Between, and learn
  to use that in their own designs. After the completing the work of the semester,
  the students hopefully understand better the ramifications of their designs on the
  surrounding spaces, and consider them as integral a part of the design process as
  the buildings themselves.
